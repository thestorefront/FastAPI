# FastAPI

Easily create robust, standardized API endpoints using lightning-fast database queries

FastAPI is a Rails library for querying interdependent datasets quickly and
returning a human-readable, standard API output.

It works by constructing complex SQL queries that make efficient use of JOINs
and subqueries based upon model dependencies (namely `belongs_to` and `has_many`).

In only a few lines of code you can decide which fields you wish to expose to
your endpoint, any filters you wish to run the data through, and create your controller.

# Preview

You can preview a live example of FastAPI at http://fastapi.herokuapp.com/

The repository is located at [thestorefront/fastapi_example](http://github.com/thestorefront/fastapi_example)


# Requirements

This gem requires Oj 2.9.9 for JSONification, and Rails (>= 3.2).

FastAPI currently supports PostegreSQL as a data layer.


# Installation

FastAPI is available via RubyGems using:

```
$ gem install fastapi
```

Otherwise, in any Gemfile in a rails project, use:

```ruby
require 'fastapi'
```


# Examples

Let's say we have three models. `Person`, `Bucket`, and `Marble`.
Each `Bucket` belongs to a `Person` and can have many `Marbles`.

Your model for `Bucket` might look something like this:

```ruby
class Bucket < ActiveRecord::Base

  belongs_to :person
  has_many :marbles

end
```

Assume `Bucket` also has the fields `:color`, and `:material`.

Each `Marble` can have `:color` and `:radius`.

Every `Person` has a `:name`, `:gender` and `:age`.

We want to expose a list of `Buckets` as a JSONified API endpoint that contains
records that look like the following:

```javascript
  {
    'id': 1,
    'color': 'blue',
    'material': 'plastic',
    'person': {
      'id': 107,
      'name': 'Mary-anne',
      'gender': 'Female',
      'age': 27
    },
    'marbles': [
      {
        'id': 22,
        'color': 'red',
        'radius': 5
      },
      {
        'id': 76,
        'color': 'green',
        'radius': 7
      }
    ]
  }
```

In order to do that we first look at our `Bucket` model and add the following:

```ruby
class Bucket < ActiveRecord::Base

  belongs_to :person
  has_many :marbles

  # A "standard interface" is a list of user-exposed fields for the endpoint
  fastapi_standard_interface :all

end
```

You can also enumerate each field you'd like to add to the interface:

```ruby
class Bucket < ActiveRecord::Base

  belongs_to :person
  has_many :marbles

  # adding the fields by providing an array of symbols
  fastapi_standard_interface [
    :id,
    :color,
    :material,
    :person,
    :marbles
  ]

end
```

We then modify our `Person` model:

```ruby
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base

  # Person is not top-level in the case of the "buckets"
  #   endpoint... we use a special setting indicating
  #   which fields to use if Person happens to be nested.

  # Dependent fields will not be included here. (belongs_to, has_many)
  #   This is a hard-and-fast FastAPI rule that prevents overly
  #   complex nesting scenarios.

  fastapi_standard_interface_nested :all
end
```

Keep in mind that this will only affect the cases where `Person` is a nested
object.

If we wanted to expose a top-level `Person` API endpoint, we would use
`fastapi_standard_interface` as well.

Finally, we must modify our `Marble` model in the same way:

```ruby
class Marble < ActiveRecord::Base

  fastapi_standard_interface_nested :all

end
```

Hmm... let's say we only want to list the `Marbles` that have a radius *less than or equal
to (<=)* 10. Easy! We go back and modify our `Bucket` model. Add the following
to `class Bucket < ActiveRecord::Base`:

```ruby
  # top level filters affect the data that is shown,
  #   while filters on "has_many" fields affect which rows are shown per
  #   record
  fastapi_default_filters({
    marbles: {
      radius__lte: 10
    }
  })
```

*Phew!* We're almost done. Now to create the endpoint.

First open `config/routes.rb` and add the following:

```ruby
namespace :api do
  namespace :v1, defaults: {format: :json} do
    resource :buckets
  end
end
```


We now create a route to an API controller for
`Bucket` in `app/controllers/api/v1/buckets_controller.rb`

(Can also use `rails generate controller Api::V1::Buckets` in the
terminal):

```ruby
class Api::V1::BucketsController < ApplicationController

  def index

    filters = request.query_parameters

    render json: Bucket.fastapi.filter(filters).response

  end

end
```

Boom! Run your server with `rails s` and hop your way over to
`http://yourserver[:port]/api/v1/buckets` to see your beautiful list of
`Buckets` in the FastAPI standard JSON format. :)

Try to filter your datasets as well:

`http://yourserver[:port]/api/v1/buckets/?color=red` or

`http://yourserver[:port]/api/v1/buckets/?color__in[]=red&color__in[]=blue`

There are many to play with, go nuts!


# Documentation

FastAPI has four core components:

1. `ActiveRecord::Base` extension that adds necessary class and instance methods
2. `class FastAPI` which is instantiated by an  `ActiveRecord::Base` instance
3. Filters, which provide a way of easily interfacing with your data
4. FastAPI standard output, a strict way of displaying all FastAPI responses

---

## ActiveRecord::Base (Extension)

### ClassMethods

#### fastapi_standard_interface
Has two method signatures that are used to set the standard interface
for the top level of a FastAPI response.

`fastapi_standard_interface( :all, { except: [], timestamps: false, foreign_keys: false, associations: true } )`

Includes attributes and associations for the model. Use the options hash
if you need to further specify which fields are included. By default, timestamps
and foreign keys are not included, but associated models are.

`fastapi_standard_interface( fields [Array] )`

Can use any available fields for the model, or `belongs_to` and `has_many`
associations. Be sure to use the correct word form (singular vs. plural).

#### fastapi_standard_interface_nested
Has two method signatures that are used to set the standard interface for the second
level of a FastAPI response (nested). Will be referred to whenever this model is
found nested in another API response. *Does not support associations*.

`fastapi_standard_interface_nested( :all, { except: [], timestamps: false, foreign_keys: false } )`

Includes attributes for the model. Use the options hash if you need to
further specify which fields are included. By default, timestamps and
foreign keys are not included.

`fastapi_standard_interface_nested( fields [Array] )`

Can use any available fields for the model.

#### fastapi_default_filters
`fastapi_default_filters( filters [Hash] )`

Sets any default filters for the top level FastAPI response. Will be
overridden if the same filter keys are provided when calling `.filter` on
a FastAPI instance. See *Filters* section for more information on available
filters.

#### fastapi_safe_field
`fastapi_safe_fields( fields [Array] )`

Sets safe fields for `FastAPIInstance.safe_filter`. These safe fields are a
*whitelist* for filters, meaning safe_filter will only allow filtering by these
fields.


### InstanceMethods

#### fastapi
`fastapi`

Shorthand for the FastAPI constructor. Equivalent to `FastAPI.new(MyModel)`.
Recommended usage is `MyModel.fastapi`.

---

## class FastAPI

`FastAPI` instances provide a way to interface with your datasets and obtain
necessary information (for an API response or otherwise).

### InstanceMethods

#### initialize
`initialize( model [Model < ActiveRecord::Base] )`

Constructor. Automatically called using `Model.fastapi`, but can be used as
`FastAPI.new(Model)`. Binds the provided Model to the FastAPI instance.

#### filter
`filter( filters [Hash] = {} , meta [Hash] = {} )`

Compiles and executes an SQL query based on the supplied filters (see *Filters*
  section for more details). Can add additional fields to the expected meta
  response in the output, as keys in the `meta` Hash.

#### safe_filter
`safe_filter( filters [Hash] = {} , meta [Hash] = {} )`

Compiles and executes an SQL query based on the supplied filters (see *Filters*
  section for more details). Will only allow filtering by fields set in
  `fastapi_safe_fields`, or `fastapi_standard_interface` if not set. Can add
  additional fields to the expected meta response in the output, as keys in the
  `meta` Hash. Intended for use with `filters = request.query_parameters`.

#### fetch
`fetch( id [Integer] , meta [Hash] = {} )`

Similar to filter, but will retrieve a single object based on a single `id`.
Ideal for `show` on a resource, as FastAPI will still format the response
appropriately (and give a customized error for id not found).

#### data
`data`

Returns a Hash containing the data from the most recently executed `filter` or
`fetch` call.

#### data_json
`data_json`

Returns a JSONified string containing the information in `data`

#### meta
`meta`

Returns a Hash containing the metadata from the most recently executed `filter`
or `fetch` call.

#### meta_json
`meta_json`

Returns a JSONified string containing the information in `meta`

#### to_hash
`to_hash`

Returns a Hash containing both the data and metadata from the most recently
executed `filter` or `fetch` call.

#### response
`response`

Intended to return the final API response. Returns a JSONified string containing
the information available in the `to_hash` method.

#### reject
`reject( message [String] = 'Access Denied' )`

Returns a JSONified string representing a standardized empty API response, with
a provided error `message`. For example, if a user is not allowed to access a
resource, you would call `render json: Model.fastapi.reject`.

---

## Filters

Filters are a powerful tool in FastAPI that allow for granular control
of your API responses. `FastAPIInstance.filter()` accepts them, and they are
also used in `ActiveRecord::Base::fastapi_default_filters`.

Filters work in the following way:
```ruby
Model.fastapi.filter({
  key1: 2,
  key2: 'three'
})
```

Will grab a subset of all `Models` where `:key1` is `2` *and* `:key2` is
`'three'`.

---

### Filter Comparators

What if we want to find a subset of `Models` where `:key1` is *greater than or
equal to (>=)* 5?

```ruby
Model.fastapi.filter({
  key1__gte: 5
})
```

It's that easy. The double underscore indicates you're using a filter
comparator, and `gte` stands for *g*reater *t*han or *e*qual to.

The available comparators are:

```
'is'          # == (Equal to)
'not'         # != (Not equal to)
'gt'          # > (Greater than)
'gte'         # >= (Greater than or equal to)
'lt'          # < (Less than)
'lte'         # <= (Less than or equal to)
'in'          # in (Array or String)
'not_in'      # not in (Array or String)
'contains'    # contains (Case sensitive)
'icontains'   # contains (Case insensitive)
'is_null'     # is null value
'not_null'    # is not null value
```

If your key contains a double underscore, make sure to use the `__is` comparator
if you look for a specific value.

---

### Filters in HTTP Requests

If you'd like to allow for client-side data filtration (highly recommended),
simply use the following in your API endpoint controller:

```ruby
filters = request.query_parameters
render json: Model.fastapi.filter(filters).response
```

This will allow you to use filters (and their comparators) in the HTTP
query parameters.

For example, `http://yourapp/api/v1/users/?active=t&age__gte=19&age__gte=35`
could return all active users between 19 and 35 years old.

---

### Data Types in HTTP Requests

While using FastAPI, boolean fields are automatically
detected, and the strings `'t'` and `'f'` are converted to `true` and `false`,
respectively. The same goes for integers. (Converted from string to int.)

---

### Sorting

In FastAPI, sorting is accomplished using a special filter: `:__order`


`:__order` Can be in the format of `'key'`, `'key,DIRECTION'` or
`[:key, 'DIRECTION']` where DIRECTION is `ASC` or `DESC`. (Default `ASC`.)

An example, order users by age (ascending):

```ruby
render json: User.fastapi.filter({__order: [:age, ASC]}).response
```

Or perhaps via HTTP (hitting an endpoint with `request.query_parameters` as the
  filter):

```
http://yourapp/api/v1/users/?__order=age,ASC
```

---

### Pagination

In FastAPI we opted for very robust, granular control of API responses. "Pages"
do not exist in a strict sense, but rather by `:__offset` and `:__count`, much
like you'd expect in a traditional database query.

For example,

```ruby
render json: Model.fastapi.filter({__offset: 100, __count: 100}).response
```

Would return (up to) 100 results from Model, beginning at result number 100.
(Page 2 at 100 results per page.)


# Standard Output

FastAPI has a very strict, standard way of outputting data in the form of
a response.

Responses will always look like the following:

```javascript
{
  'meta': {
    'total': 0,
    'count': 0,
    'offset': 0,
    'error': null,
  },
  'data': []
}
```

Where `meta.total` is the total number of records in the entire dataset,
`meta.count` is the number of records in the response, `meta.offset` is the
offset of the first record of the response, and `meta.error` is `null` if there
was no error, or a string containing an error message if there was an error.

`data` will always be an Array of Objects. If there was an error with the
response, data will be empty. If the response was formed by a
`FastAPIInstance.fetch` call and a record was retrieved, `data` will be a
length-1 Array.
